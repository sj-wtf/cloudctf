# DEFCON 31 CLoud CTF

This is a write up of the DEFCON 31 Cloud Village CTF.

Part of getting through this included getting podman up and running on my chromebook. This required some messing around with LXC settings and crosh, mostly documented [here](https://ntk.me/2021/05/14/podman-in-crostini/), but there were some additional cgroups settings documented [here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=860565)

I got 50th out of 200+ with only 3 flags. My machine didn't work for some of the challenges too, so I was kind of SOL for those challenges.
